    <h2>-About Steven Corey-</h2>
    <p>I am currently a Senior at Michigan State University. In May of 2016 I will graduate with a Bachelors degree in Media and Information. While at MSU I have spent my time studying
    web design, web applications and computer science. I am fluent in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, Python, and I am currently learning Groovy. I enjoy coding and applying its principles
    to create web sites and applications that not only meet but exceed my clients expectations.</p>
    <h2>-My Designs-</h2>
    <p>I strive to make simple yet appealing websites. When it comes to web design you never want the user to feel like they don't understand how to navigate or use your web site or application.
        To achieve this I start with a very basic design and then fill it will the pertinent information. This way the user does not have to think while they use my web sites and applications, but they
    still are able to get all of the information that they need to know.<br/>
